# quantum-channel-metrics

I have implemented the four metrics recommended in the last section of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0408063.pdf

What they call S-distance or D_stab, I have called diamond distance


To run experiments, we use circuits generated by gridsynth: https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/newsynth/

Now we need to use process tomography to get the metrics from experiments
