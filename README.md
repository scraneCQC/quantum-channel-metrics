# quantum-channel-metrics

I have implemented the four metrics recommended in the last section of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0408063.pdf

What they call S-distance or D_stab, I have called diamond distance.  It is also sometimes called the completely bounded trace norm (not to be confused with the CB norm which is the completely bounded spectral / operator norm).

Ideally, we would use convex optimization to find the sup for diamond distance and S_fidelity, but for now we try a bunch of random states and take the maximum


To run experiments, we use circuits generated by gridsynth: https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/newsynth/
