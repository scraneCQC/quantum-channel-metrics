# Quantum channel metrics

## Distance measures

I have implemented the four metrics recommended in the last section of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0408063.pdf

What they call S-distance or D_stab, I have called diamond distance.  It is also sometimes called the completely bounded trace norm (not to be confused with the CB norm which is the completely bounded spectral / operator norm).

## Circuit approximations with noise

In `where_to_stop.py` we use circuits generated by gridsynth: https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/newsynth/ and find the optimal accuracy to ask of gridsynth given a noise model

In `genetic.py` we try to find Clifford+T approximations to a random one-qubit unitary.

In `remove_subcircuits.py` (run from `remove_subcircuits.test.py`), we look for small changes to a circuit that will make it behave more like an ideal unitary than the original circuit would, given the presence of noise.  The same program can synthesize an approximation to a unitary by choosing a random starting point and then improving, but sometimes this goes very badly and I haven't worked out why.  Sometimes it is very good though.

In `tket_pauli_gadgets/tket_circuit_rewriter.py` (run from `pauli_gadget_optimiser.py`), we see if rounding an angle would allow tket to run its own optimizations on Circuits.

## Next steps

We would use convex optimization to find the sup for diamond distance and S_fidelity, but for now we try a bunch of random states and take the maximum

We would use more realistic noise models

We would consider more kinds of re-write than replacing single gates with other gates
